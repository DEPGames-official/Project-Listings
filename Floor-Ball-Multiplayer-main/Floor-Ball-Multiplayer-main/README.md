# Floor-Ball-Multiplayer
This is a deprecated project inspired from fortnite's hamster ball game mode from around July 13 2020 which I planned to make it using Unity Source Control with Multiplayer using mirror

None of my earliest projects code is good but it shows how much it changed since July 2020

Updated project for Unity 2019.4.29f1
